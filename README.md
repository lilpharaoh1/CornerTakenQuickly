Hello, this was my team's ( CornerTakenQuickly ) submission for the Formula Trinity AI Grand Prix.
We based our algorithm off of the "Follow the Gap" method. 
We saw early on that there was a trade off between speed and safety, so our system used a range of coefficients
to determine the best speed to travel at in order not to crash. 
We ended up placing third in the competition, a result we did not expect in the slightest.
I hope you find the program interesting!

The algorithm is written 100% in Python and only uses the numpy library I believe. It raced on the riders.ai
platform, the program used to conduct the race can be found here: https://gitlab.com/acrome-colab/riders-poc/f1tenth-riders-quickstart
I also included a visualiser program which displays the lidar data, this was created using the pygame library.
Some code will have to be inserted into the main.py file to get the visualiser to run, see LidarVisualiser.txt

All of the code was written by myself, Emran Moustafa. My great team mates Riley Moynihan and Oisin Cullen helped
a lot with the ideas and racing concepts needed to create the car. 
If you have any questions feel free to message me!
